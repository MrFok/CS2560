Assignment 1

SimulationDriver is set up in a way in which it will randomly choose between a multiple choice question
or a single choice question, which will use their respective question and candidates that I set up.

You can select your own question as well as your candidates in the commented area. You can also
fix the question selection randomizer so you can just get one type of question.
